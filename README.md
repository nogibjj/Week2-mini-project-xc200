# text adventure game
This code implements a simple text adventure game that allows the player to make choices and navigate through the game world. The game uses a loop to continuously display the current location and ask for player input, and read_line method from the io module to read the player's input. The game ends either when the player wins by entering the castle or loses by crossing the river.
